Building
========
Just compile source/dred/dred_main.c using your favourite compiler.

Compiling this on Unix based platforms requires the development version of the
GTK+ 3.0 library and all associated libraries (glib, gdk, atk, cairo, ...).

To compile dred on Unix based platforms use the following command:

    cc source/dred/dred_main.c -o dred `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -lm -ldl


Options
=======
#define DRED_USE_EXTERNAL_REPOS
    For use internally by developers of dred itself. This option is used to #include external dependencies
    from their own repositories rather than the "external" directory. The purpose of this option is to 
    reduce the chance of accidentally editing the wrong file when changes to external dependencies are
    needed.
