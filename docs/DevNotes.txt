1.1 Restricted Shortcuts
------------------------
Some keys and key combinations cannot be used for shortcuts because they are common shortcuts for
many different standard tasks. For example, the Delete key is a very common key that serves many
different purposes and is thus unable to be used as a shortcut. The following shortcuts cannot be
bound:

  * Delete
  * Tab
  * Shift + Tab
  
The technical reason for this is that it greatly just simplifies the design of the shortcut binding
system. The way shortcuts work is such that when a shortcut is pressed, the operating system will
block the posting of those key stroke events to the window. For example, if "Shift + Tab" is bound
to a command, when the user presses that key combination, the command will be executed, but because
the operating system detected a shortcut key press, it will prevent those key events from being
posted to the focused control. If that control happens to be a text box, that text box won't be able
to handle the Shift+Tab unindent feature.
